              recursively deletes content of a directory, including hidden files and sub directories
              depending on your configuration, it may ask for permission (for example, when using the --interactive flag). Some distributions do this by default.
              can be used to remove a directory, if you want to do so, simply give it the path of the directory (for example: /path/to/directory)
              -f
              does not recursively delete content of a directory, only removes files that directly match the given path (for example example/file1 or example/*).
              Never deletes sub directories
              Never asks for permission, basically the yes to all in Windows
